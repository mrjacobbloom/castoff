# CastOff
A MuseScore plugin. Drop-in replacement for its layout engine that fixes all systems to 2, 4, or 8 measures (casting off).

Right now there's only a MuseScore 3 version, as MuseScore 4's plugin API hasn't stabilized yet as of this writing and I expect this plugin to not be compatible.

See comment at top of plugin for technical rant.

See [MuseScore Handbook](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/plugins#installation) for installation instructions.
