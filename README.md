# CastOff
A MuseScore plugin. Drop-in replacement for its layout engine that fixes all systems to 2, 4, or 8 measures (casting off).

![Demo of CastOff in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrjacobbloom/castoff/master/demo.gif)

After you've finished note entry and are ready to think about layout, enable this plugin. It'll automagically (do its best to) fix all systems to 2, 4, or 8 measures. What's more, it stays on after that, so you can start to add your own system or page breaks, and it'll continue to adjust the rest of the score as you go! Basically, from that point on, you can treat it like a drop-in replacement for the built-in layout system.

Right now there's only a MuseScore 3 version, as MuseScore 4's plugin API hasn't stabilized yet as of this writing and I expect this plugin to not be compatible.

See comment at top of plugin for technical rant.
